Look, It's not you... no wait. It is. You're creepy. Good bye. 
I don't want to be a part of your stupid cult. Find someone else to bother.
Hahaha. Good luck with that.
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that, and then pretend I never met you. 
NO. HOW ABOUT YOU JOIN MY CULT?!
Not in a million years. Even if Cthulu rises from his slumber and consumes the world.
Sorry, but I'm actually already in a cult? I don't really think it would be appropriate. I can't realistically devote my to TWO cults. Being a devotee is a full-time commitment. Good luck though!
Well, this is awkward. I was actually trying to recruit you. Well, good luck, I guess?
I don't think that's a good idea. Last time I joined a cult there were all these hidden fees. Next thing I knew my bank account was empty, my wife left me, and the kids were asking "Why are we always eating Cheerios?!" It was a bad time.
*Sigh* Why do I always get the weird ones?
Look, I should have told you sooner. I'm not real. I'm a computer generated user. I'm sorry to cruch your hopes, but that's the truth of the matter.
