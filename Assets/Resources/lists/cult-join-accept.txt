Hell yeah! LET'S DO THIS!
Sounds cool. Count me in. 
When and where? I'll be there.
Came here seeking love, found {CULT_NAME} instead.
I thought you would never ask! Yes of course! 
Haha oh, this is interesting. I was sent to recruit you. How about you join mine and I join yours? Win-win, right?
Hmmm. Never been asked to join a cult before. Sure! Why not? What have I got to lose?
If it means spending more time with you, I would do anything.
This what I've been waiting for. A purpose! Something to dedicate my life to. Yes!
