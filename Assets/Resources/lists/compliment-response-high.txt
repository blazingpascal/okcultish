You're making me blush. 
Wow, I never thought of myself that way!
That was the nicest thing someone has ever said to me. 
I know.
You're a peach!
You're my angel. 
I'd be lost without you. 
You make my heart smile. 
You're the sweetest!
If there was ever someone who deserves praise and adulation, that person is you!
